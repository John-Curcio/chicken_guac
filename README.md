## Modifying the Game

This game is designed to be easy to modify and expand! Here are some ideas:

### Easy Changes
- **Graphics**: Replace `chicken.png` with your own image, or change emojis 🥑, 💣, 🧟‍♂️. Just ask Claude "how do I change the chicken image?"
- **Physics**: Adjust `maxSpeed`, `acceleration`, or `friction` in the chicken object
- **Zombie**: Adjust zombie `speed` (currently 2) or spawn score threshold (currently 50)
- **Colors**: Update the color schemes

### Medium Difficulty Ideas
- Add power-ups (temporary invincibility, slow-motion, extra points)
- Create different types of collectibles (different foods with different effects)
- Add sound effects for collecting, zombie spawn, collision
- Implement more enemies and enemy types

### Advanced Ideas
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty and new mechanics
- Different chicken characters with unique abilities
- Boss enemies or special zombie variants
- Leaderboards and achievements
- Level editor for custom arenas

## Getting Started with Modifications

1. **Start Small**: Try changing the chicken speed or colors first
2. **Test Often**: Refresh the browser after each change to see results
3. **Read the Code**: The `game.js` file has comments explaining each section
4. **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to break things - you can always undo changes!
5. **Talk to Claude**: Ask Claude about anything, no matter how dumb. Tell Claude what to do.
